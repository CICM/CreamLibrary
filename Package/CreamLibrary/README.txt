This version is compatible with Pure Data and Pure Data Extented.

Installation :

Copy the "CreamLibrary" folder in your Pure Data "package" folder and add "c.library" in startup preferences. 
You can also copy the "CreamLibrary" folder in another folder than the default package folder, then you have to add this folder in the path preferences and add "CreamLibrary/c.library" in the startup preferences. 

For PD-Extented or Linux 32 bits, replace the c.library external (.pd_linux, .pd_darwin or .dll) with the one that matchs to your system and your PD distribution from the externals folder. 

For PD-Extented use the startup flags "-lib c.library" (or "-lib CreamLibrary/c.library" if you use another folder than the default ones). 

In the help menu of Pure Data, the CreamLibrary folder constains informations, helps and tutorials.

Uninstall:
Remove the "CreamLibrary" folder and the startup flag .
