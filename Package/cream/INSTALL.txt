Quick compilation instructions for Gnu/linux or Mac OSX, or Windows if you have
installed gygwin: make sure "automake" is installed as well as the usual C
compiler chain. Then in this directory, run the following commands:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make

If you need jack support, add the corresponding flag to "configure":

  ./configure --enable-jack

Alternatively, you can use the fallback makefiles in "src" for gnu/linux, Mac
OSX, or Microsoft Visual C. On linux, for example, cd to src and type "make -f
makefile.gnu" and (if you wish) "sudo make -f makefile.gnu install".

Special instructions for Microsoft Visual C: cd to src and type "make -f
makefile.nt". Then CD to the various subdirs of extra and type "make nt" in
each.

Various dependencies: in linux and Mac you need TK (apparently always present
for Mac and usually there for linux). On linux you may also need an ALSA
"dev" package: (yum install alsa-lib-devel) or (apt-get install libasound2-dev).
